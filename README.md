## P component - Proportional Control
The P component controls the car on the basis of cross track error (CTE). The further the car is away from the central line of the lane, the more steering it will take. 

p_error = cte;

A larger P makes the car more sensitive to the CTE and turns the car back to the center more quickly. However, the side effect of that is the car will oscillate to a large extent. If the P value is set too small, then the car may not be able to react quick enough to CTE and go off the track in the big curve.
## I component - Integral Control
The I component, as suggested by its name, takes into account the summation of all the CTEs. The intuition is that if a car is always on the left side of the lane, we need a control to offset this systematic bias. The bias could be the result of the mechanical drift and etc.

i_error = sum(cte);

A higher I, similar to the effect of proportional control, makes the car waving wildly and a smaller I may prevent the car to correct the bias adequately and keep the car in one side of the lane for a long time.
## D component - Differential Control
The D component reacts to the delta of the CTE. When the car quickly turning back to the center of the lane, the differential control counters the steering to prevent overshooting and smooth the driving experience. The P control alone overshoots inevitably and this could be solved by adding an adequate differential control.

d_error = cte - p_error;

A very high D component will counter the P component significantly. A small D component may not be enough to prevent the overshooting problem.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
